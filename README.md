## Typography selectors

Each typography can have several groups of selectors with unique modifications based on the root typography.
For example: a typography can be set with a certain Font, Color and Font size;
each of its groups of selectors inherit those properties and one could modify the inherited color and other the inherited Font size.

Available CSS selectors include:
